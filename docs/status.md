<!-- AICODE-NOTE: STATUS/FOCUS focus: navigation docs + README index ref: README.md -->
<!-- AICODE-NOTE: STATUS/ENTRY next: populate app assets after nav per TASKS.md -->

# Status

## Latest accomplishments
- Documented the boot plan in `docs/plan-template.md` to capture scope, anchors, and checks.
- Added the README index so newcomers know where to start.
- Created the context block describing mission, stack, and invariants.

## Current focus
- Finalizing the required docs (status, decisions) and ensuring all anchors (`AICODE-*`) stay discoverable via `rg -n "AICODE-"`.

## Next up (after navigation docs)
1. Populate `app/` with the UI scaffolding described in `TASKS.md`.
2. Wire up BaseX data sources and API logic once the docs/README anchors confirm context.
